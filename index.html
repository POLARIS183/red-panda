<h2>What <i>is</i> adaptation?</h2>
<h5> Adaptation is when a characteristic of an organism (something that conforms to MRSGREN) changes to fit the environment of that organism. <br>So, for example, <i>Carnegiea gigantea,</i> or giant cactus, adapted spikes to stop animals eating it.</h5>

<h2>The Red Panda</h2>

<h5>The red panda is a mammal that's native to China and the Himalayas, so its habitat is mountainous and snowy. Its classification is Animalia-Chordata-Mammalia-Carnivora-Ailuridae-Ailurus.<br><br>It's a carnivore, even though it only eats small insects for 'meat', and it is usually eaten by martens and snow leopards. (Source: <a href="https://www.marwell.org.uk/zoo/explore/animals/10/red-panda">Marwell Zoo.</a>)<br>An interesting fact about the red panda is that many technological terms derive from its name and actions, such as the Internet search-engine <i>FireFox.</i><br>The red panda is often used in popular culture, such as the BBC's adaptation of <i>'His Dark Materials.'</i><br><br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Em5P9PUXMAE9KHA.png" alt="The character Pan (Pantalaimon) in His Dark Materials as a red panda." title="The character Pan (Pantalaimon) in His Dark Materials as a red panda." style="width:350px"><br><br>97% of their diet is made up of bamboo, and the remaining 3% contains small insects, eggs and flowers.

<h2>How has the Red Panda adapted?</h2>

<h4>Physical adaptations</h4>
<h5>They have an extra 'thumb' for holding bamboo, made up of an extra wrist bone. This helps with their feeding.<br>They have a small body mass, so that they can walk on tree branches, and evade larger, heavier predators.<br>They have sharp hind claws, so they can climb trees.<br>Their long, bushy tail acts as a pillow and their fur helps keep them warm in the snowy, Himalayan landscape.</h5>
<h4>Behavioural Adaptations</h4>
<h5>Red Pandas are nocturnal (they are awake during the night) to stop diurnal (awake during the day) predators from attacking them.<br>They also escape into the trees to help it survive; they spend most of their time there.</h5>
<h4>How does this help the Red Pandas survive?</h4>
<h5>A combination of the physical trait of its small body mass and the behavioural trait of red pandas spending most of their time in the trees helps the pandas survive; the added bonus of adapting to be nocturnal makes the pandas' survival easier.<br><br>However, the red pandas are endangered, due to poaching, and are legally protected in India, Bhutan, China, Nepal and Myanmar. (Source: <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/red-panda">Smithsonian National Zoo.</a>) This means that only 10000 red pandas are left in the wild; however, some organisations such as WWF are helping to conserve these.<br><br>Â©POLARIS183 2021.</h5><br><br>
