<h2>What <i>is</i> adaptation?</h2>
<h4> Adaptation is when a characteristic or feature of an organism (something that conforms to MRSGREN) changes to fit the environment of that organism. <br>So, for example, <i>Carnegiea gigantea,</i> or giant cactus, adapted spikes to stop animals eating it.</h4>

<h2>The Red Panda</h2>
<h4>The red panda is a mammal that's native to China and the Himalayas, so its habitat is mountainous and snowy. It usually lives for about 15 years, and its gestation period is 133 days. <br>Its classification is Animalia-Chordata-Mammalia-Carnivora-Ailuridae-Ailurus.<br><br>It's a carnivore, even though it only preys on small insects for 'meat', and it is usually eaten by martens and snow leopards. (Source: <a href="https://www.marwell.org.uk/zoo/explore/animals/10/red-panda">Marwell Zoo.</a>)<br>An interesting fact about the red panda is that many technological terms derive from its name and actions, such as the Internet search-engine <i>FireFox.</i><br>The red panda is often used in popular culture, such as the BBC's adaptation of <i>'His Dark Materials.'</i><br><br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Em5P9PUXMAE9KHA.png" alt="The character Pan (Pantalaimon) in His Dark Materials as a red panda." title="The character Pan (Pantalaimon) in His Dark Materials as a red panda." style="width:350px"><br><br>97% of their diet is made up of bamboo, and the remaining 3% contains small insects, eggs and flowers.

<h2>How has the Red Panda adapted?</h2>

<h3>Physical adaptations</h3>
<h4>They have an extra 'thumb' for holding bamboo, made up of an extra wrist bone. This helps with their feeding.<br>They have a small body mass, so that they can walk on tree branches, and evade larger, heavier predators.<br>They have sharp hind claws, so they can climb trees.<br>Their long, bushy tail acts as a pillow and their fur helps keep them warm in the snowy, Himalayan landscape.</h4>
<h3>Behavioural Adaptations</h3>
<h4>Red Pandas are nocturnal (they are awake during the night) to stop diurnal (awake during the day) predators from attacking them.<br>They also escape into the trees to help it survive; they spend most of their time there.</h4>
<h3>How does this help the Red Pandas survive?</h3>
<h4>A combination of the physical trait of its small body mass and the behavioural trait of red pandas being solitary (except for the mating season), spending most of their time in the trees helps the pandas survive; the added bonus of adapting to be nocturnal makes the pandas' survival easier.<br><br>However, the red pandas are endangered, due to poaching, and are legally protected in India, Bhutan, China, Nepal and Myanmar. (Source: <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/red-panda">Smithsonian National Zoo.</a>) This means that only 10000 red pandas are left in the wild; however, some organisations such as WWF are helping to conserve these.<br><br>Â©POLARIS183 2021.</h4><br><br>
